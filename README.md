# Popularity Growth Analysis and Prediction on Yelp

This is the final project of Stanford CS224W: Analysis of Networks

Abstract: Research on the spread of information has been gaining popularity in recent years but most of the research has focused on social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook. In this project, we analyze the cascading behavior on Yelp, with a focus on how business gets popular. We analyze the relationship between business and users and how information distribution within user social networks influences the popularity of the business. Based on the analysis we then use GraphSAGE framework to train embeddings for each business based on its cascading graph to predict its popularity.
